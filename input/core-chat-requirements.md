# Core Chat Functionality Requirements

## Real-time Messaging
- Bidirectional communication between users and AI models
- WebSocket-based real-time message delivery
- Message queuing for offline scenarios
- Support for message acknowledgments and delivery status

## Multi-AI Model Support
- Integration with OpenAI GPT models (3.5, 4, 4o)
- Claude (Anthropic) integration 
- Google Gemini model support
- Mistral AI model integration
- DeepSeek model support
- Dynamic model switching during conversations
- Model-specific configuration and parameter management

## Context Management
- Dynamic context window management per AI model
- Token counting and limit enforcement
- Context truncation strategies when limits exceeded
- Conversation state preservation across sessions
- Auto summarization of older entries if required to stay in context limits of the model
- Cross-chat context with intelligent filtering
- Context deduplication and optimization
- Source tracking and detailed metrics

## Chat History Management
- Persistent storage of conversation history
- Intelligent summarization of long conversations
- Context retrieval for continued conversations
- Export capabilities for chat history
- Possibility to easy "POST" to a chat history a new message that is not getting answered but added as "context" to the conversation

## Understanding and Intent Recognition
- Identify the users intent and context
- Contextual understanding of user input
- Intent-based response generation
- Re-Evaluate intent in idle chat handling
- Language detection and awareness
- Complexity assessment for response strategy
- Tool requirement detection and analysis

## Advanced Processing
- Linear Think → Act → Respond pipeline
- Request preprocessing and metadata collection
- Intelligent routing based on request complexity
- Performance optimization through caching
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Metrics collection for debugging and optimization

## Provider Management
- Primary provider with fallback chain (Gemini → Claude → Mistral)
- Automatic retry with escalation
- Provider health monitoring and status tracking
- Usage tracking and cost optimization
- Model-specific optimizations and configurations
