# Idle Chat Handling Requirements

## Activity Detection
- User activity monitoring and tracking
- Configurable idle timeout thresholds
- Multiple activity indicators (typing, message sending, page focus)
- Grace periods for different user interaction types

## Session Management
- Automatic session state transitions
- Idle session identification and flagging
- Session cleanup and resource management
- Session restoration capabilities

## Automated Summarization
- Intelligent conversation summarization when idle detected
- Configurable summarization triggers and timing
- Summary quality assessment and validation
- Multiple summarization strategies based on conversation length

## State Preservation
- Context preservation during idle periods
- Efficient storage of idle session data
- Quick session reactivation mechanisms
- Historical idle pattern analysis


## Functional
- Create a idle message that includes:
  - Timeline of this chat (How we progressed? Milestones achived?).
  - Topics Discussed
  - Role of the user.
  - Role of the AI
  - Missing informations in this conversation
  - Possible next steps in this conversation (next milestone?).
- Ensure that only the latest message gets a new idle summary
