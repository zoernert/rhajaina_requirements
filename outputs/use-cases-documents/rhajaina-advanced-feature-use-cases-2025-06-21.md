## Rhajaina Advanced Feature Use Cases

### 1. FILE MANAGEMENT & PROCESSING

**Use Case 1: Automated Invoice Processing**
*   **User:** Accounting Department
*   **Scenario:** Upload a batch of scanned invoices (PDFs). Rhajaina automatically performs OCR to extract relevant data (invoice number, date, amount, vendor). The extracted data is then used to create entries in the accounting system.
*   **Advanced Features Used:** Batch file processing, OCR and content extraction, Document vectorization (for vendor matching), File search and retrieval (for duplicate invoice detection).

**Use Case 2: Legal Document Review**
*   **User:** Legal Team
*   **Scenario:** Upload a large contract document. Rhajaina performs OCR and extracts key clauses (liability, termination, jurisdiction). The legal team can then use semantic search to find similar clauses in past contracts.
*   **Advanced Features Used:** File upload and processing, OCR and content extraction, Semantic search across conversations, File search and retrieval.

**Use Case 3: Research Paper Analysis**
*   **User:** Research Scientist
*   **Scenario:** Upload a collection of research papers (PDFs). Rhajaina performs OCR and extracts the text. The scientist can then use vector embeddings to identify papers with similar topics and research methodologies.
*   **Advanced Features Used:** Batch file processing, OCR and content extraction, Document vectorization, Similarity search operations.

**Use Case 4: Secure Document Sharing with External Partners**
*   **User:** Project Manager
*   **Scenario:** Upload project documents and share them with external partners. The project manager sets granular permissions (view-only, edit, download) for each partner. Rhajaina tracks access and modifications.
*   **Advanced Features Used:** File sharing and permissions, Permission management, File upload and processing.

**Use Case 5: Version Controlled Document Repository**
*   **User:** Engineering Team
*   **Scenario:** The engineering team uses Rhajaina to store and manage design documents. Each time a document is updated, a new version is created. The team can easily revert to previous versions and track changes.
*   **Advanced Features Used:** File upload and processing, File search and retrieval, Batch file processing.

**Use Case 6: Compliance Audit Trail**
*   **User:** Compliance Officer
*   **Scenario:** Rhajaina automatically logs all file access, modifications, and sharing activities. The compliance officer can generate reports to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements.
*   **Advanced Features Used:** File sharing and permissions, File upload and processing, File search and retrieval.

### 2. VECTOR SEARCH & SEMANTIC OPERATIONS

**Use Case 1: Customer Support Ticket Analysis**
*   **User:** Customer Support Manager
*   **Scenario:** Use semantic search to find similar customer support tickets based on the description of the issue. This helps the support team quickly find solutions to common problems.
*   **Advanced Features Used:** Semantic search across conversations, Vector embedding generation, Similarity search operations.

**Use Case 2: Knowledge Base Optimization**
*   **User:** Knowledge Manager
*   **Scenario:** Use vector embeddings to identify gaps in the knowledge base. For example, if there are many customer support tickets related to a specific topic, but no corresponding articles in the knowledge base, the knowledge manager can create new content to address the gap.
*   **Advanced Features Used:** Vector embedding generation, Similarity search operations, Collection management.

**Use Case 3: Personalized Product Recommendations**
*   **User:** E-commerce Platform
*   **Scenario:** Generate vector embeddings for each product based on its description and attributes. Then, use similarity search to recommend products that are similar to those that the user has previously purchased or viewed.
*   **Advanced Features Used:** Vector embedding generation, Similarity search operations, Metadata filtering and indexing.

**Use Case 4: Threat Detection**
*   **User:** Security Analyst
*   **Scenario:** Vectorize network traffic data and use similarity search to identify anomalous patterns that may indicate a security threat.
*   **Advanced Features Used:** Vector embedding generation, Similarity search operations, Metadata filtering and indexing.

**Use Case 5: Patent Search**
*   **User:** Research and Development Team
*   **Scenario:** Vectorize patent documents and use semantic search to find prior art that may invalidate a new invention.
*   **Advanced Features Used:** Semantic search across conversations, Vector embedding generation, Similarity search operations.
