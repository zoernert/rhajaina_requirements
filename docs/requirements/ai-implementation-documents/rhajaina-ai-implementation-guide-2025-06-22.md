## 2. AI Prompting Strategies

Effective prompting is crucial for maximizing the benefits of AI coding assistants. This section outlines strategies for crafting prompts that elicit the desired responses from AI models.

### 2.1. Prompting for Requirements Gathering

Gathering clear and complete requirements is the foundation of any successful software project. AI coding assistants can be used to help elicit requirements, define user stories, and create acceptance criteria.

**Techniques:**

*   **Role-Playing:** Ask the AI to act as a business analyst or a user to identify potential requirements.
*   **Scenario-Based Prompts:** Present the AI with specific scenarios and ask it to generate requirements based on those scenarios.
*   **Questioning:** Use prompts to ask the AI clarifying questions about the project goals and user needs.

**Examples:**

*   **User Story Generation:**
    ```
    Generate a user story for a user who wants to be able to export data from the Rhajaina platform to a CSV file.
    ```
*   **Acceptance Criteria Generation:**
    ```
    Generate acceptance criteria for the user story: "As a user, I want to be able to export data from the Rhajaina platform to a CSV file."
    ```
*   **Requirement Clarification:**
    ```
    What are the potential security risks associated with allowing users to upload files to the Rhajaina platform?
    ```

**Strategies for Handling Ambiguous or Conflicting Requirements:**

*   **Prompt the AI to identify potential ambiguities or conflicts in the requirements.**
*   **Use the AI to generate alternative interpretations of the requirements.**
*   **Ask the AI to suggest ways to resolve the conflicts.**

### 2.2. Prompting for Design and Architecture

AI coding assistants can be used to generate architectural diagrams, design specifications, and component definitions. This can help accelerate the design process and ensure that the architecture is well-defined.

**Techniques:**

*   **High-Level Design Prompts:** Ask the AI to generate a high-level architectural diagram based on the project requirements.
*   **Component Design Prompts:** Use prompts to define the interfaces and functionality of individual components.

*   **Use comments to explain the purpose of the code.**

**Techniques:**

*   **Function Generation:** Ask the AI to generate a function that performs a specific task.
*   **Class Generation:** Use prompts to create classes with specific attributes and methods.
*   **API Generation:** Ask the AI to generate an API endpoint that exposes a specific functionality.

**Examples:**

*   **Function Generation:**
    ```
    Generate a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of the numbers.
    ```
*   **Class Generation:**
    ```
    Generate a Java class that represents a user, with attributes for name, email, and password.
    ```
*   **API Generation:**
    ```
    Generate a Moleculer service action within the 'RequestProcessor' service in Node.js that accepts a user message and initiates the 'Think -> Act -> Respond' pipeline.
    ```

### 2.4. Prompting for Testing and Debugging

AI coding assistants can be used to generate test cases, identify potential bugs, and assist in debugging code.

**Techniques:**

*   **Test Case Generation:** Ask the AI to generate test cases based on the requirements or code specifications.

*   **Debugging Assistance:** Ask the AI to help you debug code by analyzing error messages and suggesting potential solutions.

**Examples:**

*   **Test Case Generation:**
    ```
    Generate unit tests for the Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.
    ```
*   **Bug Identification:**
    ```
    Identify potential security vulnerabilities in the following code:
    [Insert code here]
    ```
*   **Debugging Assistance:**
    ```
    I am getting the following error message: [Insert error message here]. What could be the cause of this error?
    ```

### 2.5. Prompt Engineering Techniques

*   **Few-shot learning:** Provide a few examples of the desired input-output pairs to guide the AI model.
*   **Chain-of-thought prompting:** Encourage the AI to explain its reasoning process step-by-step.
*   **Self-consistency:** Generate multiple responses and select the most consistent one.
*   **Retrieval-augmented generation:** Provide the AI with relevant context from external sources.
