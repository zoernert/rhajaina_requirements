# Rhajaina Implementation Blueprint - Backend

## 1. Introduction

This blueprint provides a step-by-step guide for building a Moleculer-based backend API. Moleculer is a fast, scalable, and fault-tolerant microservices framework for Node.js.

This blueprint is intended for backend developers, DevOps engineers, and architects who are familiar with microservices concepts but may be new to Moleculer.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js and npm (or yarn)
*   Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerization)
*   A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text)
*   Basic understanding of JavaScript and asynchronous programming
*   Familiarity with microservices architecture principles

## 2. Moleculer API Gateway Setup and Configuration

### 2.1. Installation

The Moleculer API Gateway requires the `moleculer` and `moleculer-web` packages.

**Installation using npm:**

```bash
npm install moleculer moleculer-web --save
```

**Installation using yarn:**

```bash
yarn add moleculer moleculer-web
```

**Example `package.json` snippet:**

```json
"dependencies": {
  "moleculer": "^0.14.0",
  "moleculer-web": "^0.9.0"
}
```

### 2.2. Basic Configuration

The `moleculer.config.js` file is the main configuration file for the Moleculer broker. Create this file in the root directory of your project.

**Essential Configuration Options:**

*   **`nodeID`:** A unique identifier for the node in the Moleculer cluster.

    ```javascript
    nodeID: 'api-gateway-1'
    ```

*   **`transporter`:** Responsible for communication between services. Options include NATS, Redis, and TCP.

    ```javascript
    transporter: 'nats://localhost:4222'
    ```

*   **`logger`:** Used for logging messages from the broker and services.

    ```javascript
    logger: true
    ```

**Sample Configuration File:**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  nodeID: 'api-gateway-1',
  transporter: 'nats://localhost:4222',
  logger: true,
};
```

### 2.3. Route Configuration

Routes map external requests to internal services. Define routes in the `routes` array within the `moleculer-web` service options.

```javascript
routes: [
  {
    path: '/api',
    // ... other route options
  }
]
```

**Using Aliases:**

Aliases map specific HTTP methods and URL paths to service actions.

```javascript
aliases: {
  'GET /users': 'users.list',
  'POST /users': 'users.create',
}
```

**Route-Level Middleware:**

Middleware can intercept and modify requests and responses at the route level.

```javascript
use: [
  (req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`Request received at ${req.url}`);
    next();
  }
]
```

**Complete Example:**

```javascript
routes: [
  {
    path: '/api',
    aliases: {
      'GET /users': 'users.list',
      'POST /users': 'users.create',
    },
    use: [
      (req, res, next) => {
        console.log(`Request received at ${req.url}`);
        next();
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### 2.7. Load Balancing

(Content about Load Balancing would go here, including different strategies)

### 2.8. SSL/TLS Termination

(Content about SSL/TLS Termination would go here, including reverse proxy examples)

## 3. Service Implementations with Actions and Events

## 6. Conclusion

This blueprint provides a foundation for building a Moleculer-based backend API. Further customization and expansion will be required based on specific application requirements.
