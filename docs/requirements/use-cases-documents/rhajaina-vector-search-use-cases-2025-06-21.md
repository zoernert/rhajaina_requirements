# Vector Search Use Cases

## UC-017: Semantic Search Across Chats
**Actor:** User
**Goal:** Find relevant information across multiple chat conversations using semantic understanding.
**Steps:**
1. User initiates a search query.
2. System converts the query into a vector embedding.
3. System searches chat history for semantically similar vector embeddings.
4. System returns chat messages ranked by semantic similarity to the query.

## UC-018: Generate Vector Embeddings
**Actor:** System
**Goal:** Convert text data into vector embeddings for semantic analysis and search.
**Steps:**
1. System receives text data (e.g., chat message, document).
2. System processes the text data through a pre-trained language model.
3. Language model generates a vector embedding representing the semantic meaning of the text.
4. System stores the vector embedding in a vector database.

## UC-019: Find Similar Conversations
**Actor:** User
**Goal:** Identify chat conversations that are similar in topic or content to a given conversation.
**Steps:**
1. User selects a chat conversation.
2. System generates a vector embedding for the selected conversation.
3. System searches for other conversations with similar vector embeddings.
4. System returns a list of similar conversations, ranked by similarity score.

## UC-020: Filter Search Results
**Actor:** User
**Goal:** Refine vector search results based on specific criteria.
**Steps:**
1. User performs a vector search.
2. System returns initial search results.
3. User applies filters (e.g., date range, sender, keywords).
4. System filters the vector search results based on the applied criteria.
5. System displays the filtered search results.
