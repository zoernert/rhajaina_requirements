  roles: [String], // User roles (e.g., user, admin)
  settings: {
    theme: String, // User's preferred theme (e.g., light, dark)
    notificationsEnabled: Boolean, // Flag to enable/disable notifications
    language: String // User's preferred language
  }
}
```

#### chats Collection:

```json
{
  _id: ObjectId, // Unique chat identifier
  name: String, // Chat name (optional, e.g., group chat name)
  type: String, // Chat type (e.g., direct, group)
  participants: [ObjectId], // Array of user ObjectIds participating in the chat
  createdAt: Date, // Timestamp of chat creation
  updatedAt: Date, // Timestamp of last chat update
  lastMessage: ObjectId, // ObjectId of the last message in the chat
  isArchived: Boolean, // Flag indicating if the chat is archived
  settings: {
    muteNotifications: Boolean // Flag to mute notifications for this chat
  }
}
```

#### messages Collection:

```json
{
  _id: ObjectId, // Unique message identifier
  chatId: ObjectId, // ObjectId of the chat this message belongs to
  senderId: ObjectId, // ObjectId of the user who sent the message
  content: String, // Message content
  timestamp: Date, // Message timestamp
  status: String, // Message status (e.g., sent, delivered, read)
  isEdited: Boolean, // Flag indicating if the message has been edited
  isDeleted: Boolean, // Flag indicating if the message has been deleted
  attachments: [String], // Array of URLs to attached files (optional)
  reactions: [
    {
      userId: ObjectId, // ObjectId of the user who reacted
      emoji: String // Emoji used for the reaction
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ai_interactions Collection (Optional):

```json
{
  _id: ObjectId, // Unique interaction identifier
  timestamp: Date, // Timestamp of the interaction
  userId: ObjectId, // ObjectId of the user involved
  chatId: ObjectId, // ObjectId of the chat involved
  input: String, // Input provided to the AI model
  output: String, // Output generated by the AI model
  modelName: String, // Name of the AI model used
  modelVersion: String, // Version of the AI model used
  responseTime: Number, // Time taken for the AI model to respond (in milliseconds)
  cost: Number, // Cost of the AI interaction (if applicable)
  feedback: String, // User feedback on the AI interaction (optional)
  metadata: Object // Additional metadata about the interaction (optional)
}
```

### Data Relationships and Indexing:

*   **Relationships:**
    *   `users` and `chats`: A many-to-many relationship. Use an array of `ObjectId` in the `chats.participants` field to reference users.
    *   `chats` and `messages`: A one-to-many relationship. Use the `chatId` field in the `messages` collection to reference the `chats` collection.
    *   `users` and `messages`: A one-to-many relationship (sender). Use the `senderId` field in the `messages` collection to reference the `users` collection.
    *   `users` and `ai_interactions`: A one-to-many relationship. Use the `userId` field in the `ai_interactions` collection to reference the `users` collection.
    *   `chats` and `ai_interactions`: A one-to-many relationship. Use the `chatId` field in the `ai_interactions` collection to reference the `chats` collection.
*   **Indexing:**
    *   `users`: Index the `username` and `email` fields for fast user lookup.  Create a compound index on `firstName` and `lastName` for efficient name-based searches.
    *   `chats`: Index the `participants` array for efficient retrieval of chats for a given user. Index the `type` field for filtering chats by type.
    *   `messages`: Index the `chatId` field for efficient retrieval of messages for a given chat. Index the `senderId` field for retrieving messages sent by a specific user. Index the `timestamp` field for sorting messages by time.
    *   `ai_interactions`: Index the `userId`, `chatId`, `modelName`, and `timestamp` fields for efficient querying and analysis of AI interactions.

### Data Migration Strategies:

*   **Schema Updates:**
    *   Use MongoDB's online schema changes feature to add or modify fields without downtime.
    *   For complex schema changes, use a rolling update strategy to update the application code and database schema in stages.
    *   Use a feature flagging system to gradually roll out new features that rely on the updated schema.
*   **Data Migration:**
    *   Use `mongodump` and `mongorestore` for full database migrations.
    *   Use MongoDB's aggregation pipeline to transform and migrate data between collections.
    *   Write custom scripts to migrate data from other sources, ensuring data validation and transformation.
    *   Consider using a change stream to capture changes in the source database and apply them to the target database.

### Backup and Recovery Plans:

*   **Regular Backups:**
    *   Schedule regular backups using `mongodump` or MongoDB Atlas's backup service.
    *   Store backups in a secure and offsite location.
    *   Test backups regularly to ensure they can be restored successfully.
*   **Point-in-Time Recovery:**
    *   Enable oplog to allow for point-in-time recovery.
    *   Use MongoDB Atlas's point-in-time recovery feature.
*   **Disaster Recovery:**
    *   Replicate the MongoDB cluster across multiple availability zones or regions.
    *   Implement a failover mechanism to automatically switch to a secondary replica in case of a primary replica failure.
    *   Regularly test the disaster recovery plan to ensure it works as expected.
