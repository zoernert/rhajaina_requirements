1.  **Launch:** The user opens the application.
2.  **Authentication:** The user logs in or signs up (if a new user).
3.  **Chat Selection:** The user selects an existing chat or starts a new one.
4.  **Chat Interaction:** The user sends and receives messages.
5.  **Settings/Profile:** The user accesses settings or profile information.
6.  **Logout:** The user logs out of the application.

**Detailed User Flow Diagrams:**

*   **New User Onboarding:** Diagram illustrating the steps a new user takes from initial app launch to starting their first chat.
*   **Existing User Login:** Diagram illustrating the steps an existing user takes to log in and access their chats.
*   **Chat Creation:** Diagram illustrating the steps a user takes to start a new chat.

### Responsive Design Specifications

The application will be designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This will be achieved through:

*   **Fluid Layouts:** Using percentage-based widths and heights instead of fixed pixel values.
*   **Flexible Images:** Ensuring images scale appropriately on different screen sizes.
*   **Media Queries:** Using CSS media queries to apply different styles based on screen size.

**Breakpoint Specifications:**

*   **Mobile (320px - 767px):** Single-column layout with optimized touch interactions.
*   **Tablet (768px - 1023px):** Two-column layout with the chat list on the left and the chat interface on the right.
*   **Desktop (1024px and above):** Three-column layout with the chat list, chat interface, and user profile/settings on the same screen.

### Accessibility Requirements

The application will be designed to be accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1 Level AA standards. Key accessibility considerations include:

*   **Semantic HTML:** Using semantic HTML elements to provide structure and meaning to content.

## 2. USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN

### User Journey Mapping

User journey maps will be created to visualize the user's experience with the application, identifying pain points and opportunities for improvement. Key user journeys include:

*   **Onboarding Journey:** The user's experience from initial app launch to completing the onboarding process.
*   **Chatting Journey:** The user's experience while engaging in a conversation.
*   **Settings Journey:** The user's experience while managing their settings and profile.

**Example User Journey Map (Chatting Journey):**

*   **Stage 1: Starting a Chat:** User opens the app, selects a contact, and initiates a chat. Potential pain points: Difficulty finding the right contact, unclear chat initiation process.
*   **Stage 2: Sending a Message:** User types a message and sends it. Potential pain points: Slow message sending, unclear confirmation of message delivery.
*   **Stage 3: Receiving a Message:** User receives a message from the AI. Potential pain points: Delayed message delivery, irrelevant or unhelpful responses.
*   **Stage 4: Ending a Chat:** User closes the chat or switches to another conversation. Potential pain points: Difficulty ending the chat, losing context when switching conversations.

### Interaction Patterns

The application will utilize consistent and familiar interaction patterns to enhance usability. Key interaction patterns include:

*   **Swipe Gestures:** Using swipe gestures for navigation (e.g., swiping left/right to switch between chats).
*   **Tap/Click Actions:** Using tap/click actions for selecting items, sending messages, and interacting with UI elements.
*   **Long Press Actions:** Using long press actions for accessing contextual menus or options.
*   **Drag and Drop:** Using drag and drop for file attachments (if applicable).

### Feedback Mechanisms

The application will provide clear and timely feedback to users to keep them informed about the status of their actions. Key feedback mechanisms include:

*   **Confirmation Messages:** Displaying confirmation messages after successful actions (e.g., "Message sent successfully").
*   **Error Messages:** Displaying clear and informative error messages when something goes wrong.
*   **Sound Effects:** Using subtle sound effects to provide auditory feedback (e.g., a sound when a new message is received).
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Using haptic feedback (vibration) to provide tactile feedback (e.g., a vibration when a message is sent).

### Performance Expectations

The application will be designed to provide a smooth and responsive user experience. Key performance expectations include:

*   **Fast Loading Times:** The application should load quickly, ideally within 2-3 seconds.
